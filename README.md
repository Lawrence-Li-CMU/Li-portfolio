# About Me
Hello guys, I am Lawrence Li and I am pursuing a Master of Entertainment Industry Management at Carnegie Mellon University with an expected completion date of May 2021. Within five years of graduation, I plan to join a strategy consulting company with the goal of becoming a marketing consultant. More importantly, I will focus on a specific community and narrow my industry of expertise to the TMT sector for further study. Within this sector I will focus on the Asian American community and multi-national collaborations with firms in the Asian-Specific region.
